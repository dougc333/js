REDO: replace cs142/project 2 w JS/async JS exercises. 
cs142 outline:
1) css w/flexbox
2) js patterns, map, reduce, etc..
3) JS and DOM build date picker, template processing, 
4) page gen w/react, simple MVC





Programming in the small Solution files for JS class following Java CodingBat questions. 
This may be too simplistic for programmers, good for people w no programming experience. Not sure I see the point of keeping this
Warmup #1: (pre async)
for loops() over all chars in string
creating strings using concat
integer 
counters in for loops
Warmup #2: 
looping and testing str().length

Update: ES6 and async programming require small test demo programs to see if they belong in a coding style guide. 

definite keepers for lecture:
callbacks 
async looping w callbacks
destructuring
template literals
test and insert 0 if empty if not increment count
